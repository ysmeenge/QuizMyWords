# QuizMyWords
Practice your word lists with different types of quizzes, get hints, and receive a final score!



## How the quiz works:

1. You are asked to type in the name of the word list you want to be quizzed
2. Then you are asked which language you want to practice (e.g. from English to Spanish or from Spanish to English)
3. Then you can decide what type of quiz you want to do (flash cards, multiple choice etc)
4. The quiz starts and you have to answer all questions
5. At the end you get a grade
6. You're asked if you want to do another quiz
